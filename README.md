# Spot It! Generator

A Python project for generating Spot It! (a.k.a Dobble) cards.

## Description

This projects generates the sheets with Spot It! cards. The images are randomly sized and rotated. The cards' images are laid out according to circle packing algorithm. 

Used images shall be square shaped and use same background color as cards.

The placeholder numbered images can be generated by `utilities/image_generator.py`. This is done with OpenCV library.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/LukasMaly/spot-it-generator.git
```

```
cd ./spot-it-generator
```

Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required packages

- **circlify** - circle packing layout algorithm
- **ReportLab** - library for generating PDFs and graphics

## Usage

Copy input images into `./images/`.

Set parameters (such are order of the game or sheet specifications) in `main.py` and run it:

```
python main.py
```

The result sheet will be rendered into `cards.pdf`.

## Running the tests

Run the tests for cards generation:

```
python -m unittest tests/test_cards.py 
```
